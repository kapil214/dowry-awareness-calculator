### ðŸ”´ [**View the Live Project Here**](https://kapil214.github.io/dowry-awareness-calculator/)

> **Important Disclaimer:** This is a satirical social awareness project. It is designed to look like a "dowry calculator" to shock users and deliver a powerful message about the horrific reality of dowry-related violence and deaths in India. This project **condemns the illegal and immoral practice of dowry** in the strongest possible terms.

## The Concept

The project presents a provocative web interface that mimics a calculator for dowry, a harmful and illegal practice. Users are prompted to enter qualifications often considered in the context of arranged marriages (age, profession, salary, etc.).

When the "Calculate Now" button is clicked, the tool does not provide a monetary value. Instead, it confronts the user with a stark, real statistic about the number of women who lose their lives due to dowry harassment in India, revealing the true cost of this practice.

## The Message

The goal is to subvert expectations and force a moment of reflection. By juxtaposing a transactional "calculation" with the tragic human cost, the project aims to make users think critically about the dehumanization inherent in the dowry system. The final message is clear: a person's worth is not a price tag.

## Features

-   Clean, modern UI designed to look like a real, plausible application.
-   Interactive form to engage the user before the reveal.
-   A "bait-and-switch" modal that displays a powerful social message instead of a calculation.
-   Fully responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

-   **HTML5:** For the structure of the application.
-   **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Flexbox & Grid), and animations.
-   **JavaScript:** For the form logic and interactive modal functionality.
